## Overview

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers that they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name into the input field the application will display the burger on the left hand side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button associated with it. When the user clicks the "Devour it!" button the burger will move to the right side of the page. This app will store every burger in a database , whether devoured or not...Go ahead and give it a try!.
